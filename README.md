# 2D convection equation
the convection equation is written as :

the code allows me to solve it for any given initial condition

the plot bellow is the effect of wind speed on cooling speed

which means that I plot 1/t(v) where t(v) is the time taken to cool a point at a certain temperature with respect to the wind speed v

we can see the correlation between 1/t(v) and ln x

the code also can be used to solve the heat equation (conduction)

## paper
here is the paper written in french because I'm french and it was at first a school project. (it s not long, it's about 4 pages with figures)
